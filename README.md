# Teaching-metagenomics-in-Colab

Supplemental materials for "Teaching genomics to life science undergraduates using
cloud computing platforms with open datasets" submitted to Biochemistry and Molecular biology education.

Laboratory-based research projects were not possible during COVID-19. Instead, we used open datasets to provide computational research projects in metagenomics to biochemistry undergraduates using Google Colab and QIIME2

There are 3 notebooks all linked to Google Colab to retrieve amplicon sequencing data and analyze with QIIME2.
